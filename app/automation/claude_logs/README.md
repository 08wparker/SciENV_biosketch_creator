# Claude Browser Extension Automation Logs

This folder contains JavaScript files generated by Claude in Chrome browser extension while inspecting the SciENcv website. These files document:

1. **Accessibility selectors** for form elements (using ARIA labels)
2. **Data structures** for each section
3. **Step-by-step automation logic**

## Files

### Setup
| File | SciENcv Section |
|------|-----------------|
| `create_document.js` | Create New Document dialog |

### Main Biosketch Sections
| File | SciENcv Section |
|------|-----------------|
| `section_a_education.js` | A. Professional Preparation (Education/Training) |
| `section_b_appointments_positions.js` | B. Appointments and Positions |
| `section_c_products.js` | C. Products (Related + Other Significant) |

### Supplement Sections
| File | SciENcv Section |
|------|-----------------|
| `supplement_a_personal_statement.js` | Supplement A. Personal Statement |
| `supplement_b_honors.js` | Supplement B. Honors |
| `supplement_c_contributions.js` | Supplement C. Contributions to Science |

## Important Notes

- **Data is dynamic**: The example data in these files is for reference only. The actual automation will use data from the user's parsed biosketch.
- **Selectors use accessibility labels**: Claude in Chrome uses ARIA/accessibility selectors like `'textbox "Organization *"'` rather than CSS selectors.
- **Personal Statement includes grants**: The narrative should include "Current and recently completed research support" section with grant details.

## Usage

These logs help develop automation by providing:

- Accurate selectors discovered through browser inspection
- Field order and required fields
- Example data structures
- Step-by-step workflow for each section

## Generating New Logs

1. Open SciENcv in Chrome with Claude browser extension
2. Navigate to the section you want to document
3. Ask Claude to inspect the form and generate automation code
4. Save the output to a new `.js` file in this folder
